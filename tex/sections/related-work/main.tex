This chapter presents a literature review on relevant IQA and multifocus image fusion techniques, which guided the development of our method. The continuous search for an objective image quality assessment technique covered several strategies, such as subjective testing, statistical modelling, brain science, perceptual modelling, saliency detection and machine learning \cite{tang2019feature}. Every strategy basis has its advantages and trade offs, which depend on the nature of the images. We aim to develop a Fourier Transform based method in terms of precision, computational performance and robustness for bright-field microscopy images.

There are challenging features on the multifocus image fusion part of our method, such as the blurring and illumination patterns, inherent to the bright-field microscopy images. The most trivial pixel-level fusion techniques are simple mathematical operations such as the average or a weighted average of gray levels; those are capable of performing the task, but also deliver losses in basic image features, e.g. contrast and saturation \cite{zhang2009multifocus}. Thus, there is a demand for techniques that rely on more sophisticated tools, capable of covering multiple situations: images with different resolutions, light conditions and exposure times, for instance. Multiscale transform approaches, e.g. wavelet domain transforms are good choices for the problem and provide a very flexible framework, since it depends on the chosen wavelet function \cite{pajares2004wavelet}. Our task is to propose a reliable strategy among all possibilities, and we chose an edge-based pixel-level one.
