This chapter presents a literature review on relevant IQA and multi-focus image fusion techniques, which guided the development of our method. The continuous search for an objective image quality assessment technique covered several strategies, such as subjective testing, statistical modeling, brain science, perceptual modeling, saliency detection, and machine learning \cite{tang2019feature}. Every strategy has advantages and trade-offs, according to the nature of the images. 

There are challenging features on the multi-focus image fusion part of our method, such as the blurring and illumination patterns, inherent to the bright-field microscopy images. The most trivial pixel-level fusion techniques are simple mathematical operations such as the average or a weighted average of gray levels; those are suitable to the task, but also deliver losses in basic image features, e.g. contrast and saturation \cite{zhang2009multifocus}. Thus, there is a demand for techniques that rely on more sophisticated tools, capable of covering multiple situations: images with different resolutions, light conditions and exposure times, for instance. Multiscale transform approaches, e.g. wavelet domain transforms are good choices and provide a very flexible framework since they depend on the chosen wavelet function \cite{pajares2004wavelet}.
