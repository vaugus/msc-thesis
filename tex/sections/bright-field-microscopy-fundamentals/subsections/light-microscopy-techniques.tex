As for the use of light microscopes, there are several techniques and configurations which are achieved by varying the amount of lenses and light sources: bright-field, dark-field, phase-contrast, differential interference and fluorescence \cite{roane2009microscopic}. As stated by \citeonline{lawlor2019introduction}, images in bright-field microscopy are characterized by the contrast between the sample and the bright white background, generated by transmitted light. It is commonly used in pathology and histology fields for imaging fixed cells and tissues to reveal their structure, shape, and organization. The amount of light should be controlled, since the sample might suffer substantial changes, e.g. the chlorophyll molecules when illuminated by UV and visible light suffer irreversible breakdown (photodegradation) and generate other photoproducts \cite{petrovic2017clorophyll}. The \autoref{fig:bright-field_microscopy} provides an example of bright-field microscopy image.

\subsection{Z-stacking technique}

The \textit{z-stacking} is a procedure to capture images in different positions concerning the $z$ axis, named slices, which may create a pseudo 3D image of the sample and consequently retrieve depth information about the specimen \cite{lawlor2019introduction}. \autoref{fig:z-stack-scheme} presents the scheme of a z-stack acquisition with an arbitrary object:

Objective lenses with large magnifications can only focus on a thin slice of space, which implies that the acquisition of a entirely sharp image of a thick sample will be impossible; the different structures are consequently sharp in different focal planes \cite{giusti2011artificial}. Both the visualization and the acquisition of microscopy images with the z-stacking technique can be done by performing progressive adjustments of the focus knob of the microscope or by motorized stages or objectives, capable of changing the focal plane with more precision. Each focal plane adjustment is done inwards or outwards along the $z$ axis, and the set of acquired slices contain a focused region of the sample. The distance between each slice is dictated manually or automatically. Next, the images must be aligned before any analysis is conducted.  \autoref{fig:z-stack_example} represents the differences in focus between the slices of a z-stack.
