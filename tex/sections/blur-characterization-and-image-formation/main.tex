The human eye constructs images from incident light rays on the \emph{retina}, a very complex set of photoreceptors that converts light into electrical signals which are later interpreted by the brain. The result of this process may be modelled as continuous function of two variables $f(x,y)$ which comprises the \emph{illumination} and the \emph{reflectance} information, i.e. the amount of incident light and the amount of reflected light in the scene, respectively \cite{gonzalez2018digital}.

Digital image processing deals with, as the term suggests, \emph{digital images}, i.e. discrete representations of $f(x,y)$ generated by sensors that transform the illumination and reflectance information into electrical signals. Still according to \citeonline{gonzalez2018digital}, in order to achieve this representation, the signals undergo sampling (signal conversion from continuous to discrete) and quantization (mapping of real-valued intensities to discrete pixel values). For the sake of notation simplicity, $f(x,y)$ denotes the digital image and the term ``image'' also refer to it throughout this work.

It is clear that the image formation is influenced by several factors: sensor type, scene illumination conditions, and others. In fact, each imaging system such as a camera or a microscope adds its own constraints to the process, e.g. conventional transmitted light microscopy images are only achieved with non-opaque samples \cite{rudi2020contrast}. Although there are many types of microscopy, each with its own imaging procedure, this work limits its scope to bright-field microscopy. Therefore, this chapter summarizes the bright-field microscopy image formation processes and its implications on image quality. Furthermore, it describes blur properties concerning its origins either in image formation or other events.
