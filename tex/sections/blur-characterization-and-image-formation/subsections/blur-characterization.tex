The blur effect is one type of degradation that consists of global or local information loss in the image. The defocus blur is caused by the incidence of light within an aperture with significant dimensions, where the source of light is not properly placed in accordance to the focal plane; it is related to the variables of the optical system such as depth of focus, aperture, depth of field, aberrations and so on \cite{joshi2014defocus}. According to \citeonline{smith2007modern}, every optical system exhibits blur properties, in higher or lower proportions, due to the depth of focus and its adjustment. Therefore, blurring is unavoidable to a certain extent, hence every imaging device possesses a PSF due to its optics. The PSF is also named \emph{blur kernel}.

Another useful way to mathematically describe the point spread function is through the Dirac Delta. It consists of a generalized function that represents an impulse, i.e. an infinitely high value within an infinitely small period of time \cite{bracewell2000fourier}. \autoref{fig:psf} shows an arbitrary example of a punctual source of light and its image, which suffers the spreading effect.

Namely, it is a function $\delta(x)$ that is zero-valued for any $x \neq 0$ and is infinity-valued for $x = 0$. This property can be combined with any smooth function $f\colon \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}^{n}$.
The continuous Dirac Delta may be written, as stated by \citeonline{weisstein2020delta}, as

\begin{align}
\label{eqn:dirac_delta_function}
\delta^{2}(x,y)= 
\begin{cases}
    \infty, & \text{if } x^{2} + y^{2} =0\\
    0, & \text{if } x^{2} + y^{2} \neq 0
\end{cases},
&&
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
\delta^{2}(x,y)dxdy = 1.
\end{align}

\noindent The discrete version of the Dirac Delta function consists of an infinite sum instead of the integral. This concept of impulse is the point source of light, concerning images. It provides the blur effect on images, as it promotes the diffusion of the acquired information.
