In \autoref{chapter:related-work}, the literature review showed that both no-reference image quality analysis and image fusion were addressed by many known techniques such as multiresolution analysis and principal component analysis; on the other hand, applications still evolve as new strategies such as machine learning are presented. The idea that motivated the use of the Fourier Transform as the basis for an IQA method is that it is a fast, robust and reliable analysis tool and could produce relevant results if properly explored. Similarly, the image fusion process was developed by exploring many state-of-the-art fusion applications and addressing both computational requirements (both hardware and software) and computational performance, since the method is built to work on normal optical microscope workstations instead of large clusters. As a result, we studied the capabilities of the Laplacian of Gaussian as the basis for our image fusion algorithm. 

This chapter presents all the details about our no-reference image quality assessment method and our multifocus image fusion method, as well as relevant information about the proposed datasets, including acquisition details and issues. We also show how the methods relate to each other since it also requires the human knowledge to select the images for registration and posterior fusion, similar to most of the z-stacking systems on microscopy software packages.
