Experiments have been carried out for the two proposed methods: a) the NR-IQA  and b) multi-focus image fusion, both with bright-field microscopy. In this chapter, we report the performance of our methods on the created datasets and described in \autoref{chapter:materials-and-methods}. We also present the quantitative evaluation metrics used. Both IQA and image fusion experiments have been conducted on an Intel Core i7 CPU computer with 8 GB RAM, running Ubuntu Linux 18.04 64-bit.
