\simbolo{\ast}{Convolution}

This chapter summarizes the relevant theoretical concepts, methods and tools for the development of our approach to select partially sharp images among a z-stack dataset and merge the best information from each selected image into a high quality image. The mathematical and image processing employed to develop our method are convolutions, transforms, enhancement, registration, fusion and quality assessment; statistical methods are used as a bridge between yielding a quantitative index of image quality and merging pixels, as well as evaluating the performance.
