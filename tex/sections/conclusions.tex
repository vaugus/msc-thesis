% From the preliminary results, it is possible to envisage and plan the activities to be done during the year of 2019 in order to achieve better performances and also better results. Preparations for the qualification exam and took consumed most of January and February. During this period, adjustments in the code were made and the necessity of some changes was noticed. These will be implemented and tested in March and April, together with the development of scientific articles with the proposed methods and results. After some changes in the code, improvements in the methods and evaluation of the tests, the new achievements should be summarized into the thesis; this will be done in May, June and July. More improvements may be done if needed during August and September, together with the article writing step. The last three months will be dedicated to prepare the thesis and to the defense. This schedule program is graphically represented in table \ref{tab:activity_schedule}:
