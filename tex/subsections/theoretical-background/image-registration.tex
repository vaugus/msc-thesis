Image registration is the process of overlaying images (two or more) of the same scene taken at different times, from different viewpoints, and/or by different sensors. The registration geometrically align two images (the reference and sensed images) \cite{zitova2003image}.


Image registration  is  a  crucial  step  in  all  image  analysis  tasks in   which   the   final   information   is   gained   from   the combination of various  data  sources  like in image  fusion,change   detection,   and   multi channel   image   restoration. \cite{zitova2003image}.
